# Railway Deployment Setup Guide for Students

## Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you deploy your application to Railway using GitHub Actions.

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with your code repository
- Railway account (free tier available)
- Basic understanding of Git and GitHub

### Step 1: Create a Railway Account
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with your GitHub account (recommended)
3. Create a new project by clicking "New Project"
4. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Select your repository

### Step 2: Get Your Railway Token
1. In Railway, click on your profile (top right)
2. Go to "Account Settings"
3. Navigate to "Tokens"
4. Click "Create Token"
5. Give it a name like "GitHub Actions Deploy"
6. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

### Step 3: Add Token to GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Settings" (in the repo, not your profile)
3. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Name: `RAILWAY_TOKEN`
6. Value: Paste your Railway token
7. Click "Add secret"

### Step 4: Configure Your Deployment

#### For Node.js Applications:
Your `package.json` should have:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

#### For Static Sites:
The `static.json` file is already configured. Adjust these if needed:
- Change `"root": "./"` to your build directory
- For React: `"root": "./build"`
- For Vue/Vite: `"root": "./dist"`

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Push your code to the main branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. Check the deployment:
   - Go to GitHub ‚Üí Actions tab
   - Watch your workflow run
   - Green checkmark = Success!

3. Find your app URL:
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click on your project
   - Find the deployment URL

### Troubleshooting

#### Deployment Failed?
- Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
- Verify RAILWAY_TOKEN is set correctly
- Ensure tests are passing locally first

#### Tests Failing?
- Run `npm test` locally
- Fix any failing tests
- Make sure all dependencies are in package.json

#### App Not Loading?
- Check Railway logs in the dashboard
- Verify your start script is correct
- Check environment variables in Railway

### Common Commands

```bash
# Run tests locally
npm test

# Check workflow syntax
# (No command needed - GitHub validates automatically)

# Manual deployment (if needed)
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway up
```

### Environment Variables

Add environment variables in Railway:
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add your variables
5. They'll be available in your app automatically

### Tips for Students

1. **Start Simple**: Deploy a basic "Hello World" first
2. **Test Locally**: Always test before pushing
3. **Read Logs**: Error messages are your friends
4. **Use Free Tier**: Railway's free tier is perfect for learning
5. **Ask for Help**: Use Railway's Discord or your class forum
